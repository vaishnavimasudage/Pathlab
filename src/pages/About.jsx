      Pathlabs, short for pathology laboratories, are medical facilities specializing in the analysis of bodily fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases. These labs play a crucial role in healthcare by conducting tests such as blood work, biopsies, and genetic analyses. Pathologists, trained physicians, interpret results to aid in patient diagnosis and treatment. Advanced technology, including automated analyzers and molecular techniques, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of these labs. Pathlabs are integral to preventive medicine, monitoring health, and managing chronic conditions. Timely and precise results from pathlabs contribute significantly to medical decision-making and patient care.
